/*

Imagine Joel from the last of us being on trial.

Imagine what apology he'd give.

The most well known apology is Socrates'. It's like this, but Joel's.

What can Joel base his defence on?
 
 * to safe one person is uncomparable to safe them all
 
 * love is the biggest feeling
 
 * he just couldn't do otherwise
