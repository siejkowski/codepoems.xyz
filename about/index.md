# What is this page?

It's a collection of poems written in [Swift programming language](https://swift.org).

They are written by me, [Krzysztof Siejkowski](https://siejkowski.net). I'm striving to publish a new poem every week.

Writing poems in programming languages is known as [code poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_poetry).

# Do these poems actually compile and run?

Yes, they all compile and run. I'm writing them in the Xcode playgrounds. You can take a look at the [source code here](https://github.com/siejkowski/swiftpoetry.com/tree/gh-pages/playgrounds).

However, I've decided to not include the symbols definitions, like classes, variables, methods, functions etc. in the poems. I believe they would be mostly just adding the noise to the actual content. However, it's just my opinion, and it might very much change in the future! üòÑ

# Who are you and why are you writing code poetry?

I'm a software developer from Warsaw, Poland. I mostly work on mobile apps for iOS platform, which I've been doing since 2011, though I also had pleasure to work on Android apps, C++ SDKs and Scala backends.

I'm writing code poetry because I find it fascinating. I'm constantly blown away by the creativity I discover in the code poems. 

I love how diverse this literary niche is and how you can work with these poems on so many levels: the level of English language, the level of programming language, the level of the actual outcome the poem produces when it's being executed. 

I also love how much there's still to be explored in the code poetry world.

# What are some other code poetry examples?

Code poetry is a somewhat niche literary form. The samples of it are available online in various places and forms. The main sources I am following are:  

* [code::art](https://code-art.xyz) ‚Äî "an art journal which publishes code". New project curated by [Sy Brand](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama) that showcases the code poetry and other code art. Check it out! Free pdf and ability to order printed version.

* [Source Code Poetry Challenge](http://sourcecodepoetry.com) ‚Äî a competition held annually where people from all around the world share their code poems and the jury chooses 3 best ones. Their [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CodePoetry/) is the most up-to-date one.  

* [code \-\-poetry](http://code-poetry.com) by [Daniel Holden](http://theorangeduck.com) and [Chris Kerr](https://www.chriskerrpoet.com) ‚Äî a great book of code poetry, available also in pdf and print form, but website shows the execution of the poems which is really well crafted

* Stanford Code Poetry slam ‚Äî a slam organized few times (four times?) at the Stanford University. Most links are unfortually already dead but a Google search should bring various media articles about the events.  

* [Vienna Code Poetry slam](https://codepoetry.at) ‚Äî a slam held annually at Vienna, Austria.  


There are also multiple various pages, blogs, tumblrs, instagram feeds, facebook feeds, twitter profiles and so on. I encourage you, whatever social media you use or whatever browsing habits you have, just search for "code poetry" at your platform of choice.
