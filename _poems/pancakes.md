    he.asked(for: pancakes) - making.them(right.now,
    with: apple.slices, the: favourite.kind)

    [ 91: this.morning, 85: the.night ]
    ( 89, 84, 86, 90-fine )
    [ O₂, O₂, i.fear, me.too ]

    literal.reality && virtual.care {[

    :the:drake:equation:with:), no: aliens(with: cure) (

    you.know, these.days, hospitals.and.all,
    but: 91 > 85, the.appetite is back,
    and: Iʼve.made.him.pancakes, of: his.favourite.kind) ]}
